		Welcome.<br/>
		Just a script that might help someone to build his Asterisk box.<br/>
		Creates csv files for mass import of extensions compatible with Elastix and Freepbx.<br/>
		For the Elastix you must use the batch extensions function.<br/>
		For the Freepbx you must install the bulk extensions module.<br/>
		Also you can make extensions for standard Asterisk installations but very limited.<br/>
		Finally you can make only SIP or IAX extensions, no ZAP support.<br/>
		Also you can\'t import display names, there are the same with the extension number.<br/>
		Have fun!<br/>
